# This Repo is for IND320: Data to Decisions

## Project Description 

This repository accompanies the IND320 course at NMBU. In the course I work with data and visualize key insights. I also build forecasts, train machine-learning models, and use tools such as Docker and PySpark.

The first part of the project is a dashboard built with Streamlit (link below). The dashboard is meant to present data clearly so it can support good decisions, similar to what you might do in tools like Power BI.

### GitHub Repo:
https://github.com/fheflo1/IND320

- Contains all the code behind the Streamlit app.
- src: Includes a PDF describing AI usage and the development workflow.

### Streamlit App:
https://ind320-fheflo1.streamlit.app/

- To run the app, just click the link. Give it a little time to start up.
- In the app you can navigate through different pages and explore the data.
