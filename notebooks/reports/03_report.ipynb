    "AI is consitantly used for this project. Setting up the resources correctly and guiding me through my issues. I had around 70% code completions from Copilot on this assignment. If we compare it to the previous assignment, I had only around 30% code completions. Since I have used a structure (explained in **01_report** under Compulsory Work) for the Elhub data which can be repeated for the open-meteo data, copilot knew how to complete a lot of the code I was producing. I also used ChatGPT to set up the streamlit pages."

    "Since I used a structure with **Bronze**, **Silver** and **Gold** for the Elhub data in the previous assignment, I kept the system for this assignment. The structure became so that inside the **notebooks/**, I add a folder for each API I want to fetch and process data. Trying to do this modular with functions stored in **src/**. For each of the different APIs there will be a folder, for now elhub and meteo, consisting of the **Bronze**, **Silver** and **Gold** structure. Since the Open-meteo data didn't need any processing, it only goes to silver, with the analysing there. \n",
    "\n",
    "The Elhub data was uploaded to a MongoDB server after being stored and processed in Cassandra. This was not necessary for the meteo-data. The streamlit page was supose to just fetch the data via API, so the process for the the working with the meteo-data in the notebooks was quite sort. The focus was mostly on the more on analytical prospect of the assignment, trying to get good plots and readable results.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The restructuring of the pages for the streamlit app was something of the hardest about this assingmnet. Fixing old pages, renaming and making sure the new pages, A and B, was correct. After reviewing feedback from others, I have also fixed a lot when it coems to the estetics, e.g. consistantly using one color for a specific feature on the **Energy Production** page. The buttons on the front page is still weird, but don't bug and overlap when the app is not in full screen. "
