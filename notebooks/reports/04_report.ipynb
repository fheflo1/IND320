    "For this assignment, I have used AI a little different. I have used AI to complete the tasks, such as completing the map page and so on. The way I did this was to ask AI for a template and the trying to customize it to fit my requirements. I also used AI to dubug logical error which I most of the times had to deal with since the AI don't work well with logical tasks. I also tried giving a issue to GitHub Copilot, were the task was to reconstruct data loading and session states. It worked really well, but when I tried with another issue which was customizing the navigasion, it kinda failed, destructing other parts. "

    "Most tasks of the assignment went well. When creating the map, I struggled with Streamlit reloading and also map reloading, which is still not very good. I tried both Plotly map and Folium, and ended up using the Folium map. Since this assignment encouraged customizing the app with user-friendly navigation, plots, and general functionality, I put a lot of effort into this. I tried two different custom navigation approaches, but both felt less intuitive or less aesthetic than the Streamlit built-in page navigation. I tried using just the sidebar with simple page switching which lagged, and I didn't find a good solution for this. Then I also tried the streamlit_option_menu library which I felt had a lot of potential, but the sidebar ended up looking chunky and hiding other sidebar controls I wanted visible. Even though this separated the different categories in a great way which was super user-friendly, I thought the default navigation was better for this app. On every page which only showed energy production, I added energy consumption. I tried changing the color of backgrounds and plots, going from darker blues to lighter greens for the background. I renamed pages to make more sense for the user. Since the same data is used throughout the app's different pages, I load states only in the first page which increases the speed and we don't need to load the data in each page separately.\n",

    "In the bonus section, I added cache and spinners for most elements in the app. I also added weather features as exogenous variable for the forecast. I also have some error handeling, but not focused on this for the bonus section. "
